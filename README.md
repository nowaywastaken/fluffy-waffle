**Goal**: Start thinking from first principles and develop an AI programming command-line tool that is zero-trust, zero-compromise, containerized, and vendor-agnostic.

## 10 Core Principles
1. Human judgment is a valuable resource.
2. The person directing the AI may not be reliable.
3. AI outputs should not be fully trusted.
4. AI must have a deep understanding of the codebase.
5. Writing code before testing is pointless.
6. Version control is essential.
7. Refactoring is an ongoing process; there's no need to overthink it.
8. Containerization is the trend, enabling both environment isolation and seamless cloud migration.
9. Communication inevitably leads to information loss and misunderstandings.
10. Maintaining constructive criticism helps refine proposals.
