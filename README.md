**Goal**: Develop a vendor-agnostic AI programming command-line tool based on the zero-trust model and containerization technology.

## Core Principles (based on first principles)
1. Human judgment is a valuable resource.
2. The person directing the AI may not be reliable.
3. AI outputs should not be fully trusted.
4. Memorization only teaches AI to please; it doesn't make it truly intelligent.
5. AI must have a deep understanding of the codebase.
6. Writing code before testing is pointless.
7. Version control is essential.
8. Refactoring is an ongoing process; there's no need to overthink it.
9. Containerization is the trend, enabling both environment isolation and seamless cloud migration.
10. Communication inevitably leads to information loss and misunderstandings.
11. Maintaining constructive criticism helps refine proposals.
